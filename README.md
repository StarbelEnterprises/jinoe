# jinoe Project

## Collabration Guide for a team

- We have two Branches on this project , `main` and `develop`

   Roles for Branches:
    - main : set for Final and ready  to  be deployed features
    - develop : set for on development features or fixes

## Instructions we will be following to collabrate effectivelly

- Create a new branch for every seprate feature or fixies from  `develop` and ones the feature is done you will be allowed to merge your `feat-branch `to `develo` and `develop` to `main` then `main` tp production .

## Pros of doing this
 - To avoid unnecesssary merging conflicts
 - Merging our commits for every separate features or fixes
